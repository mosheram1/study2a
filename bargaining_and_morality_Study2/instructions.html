        <p>
            Thank you for participating in this research study. The study will take about <strong>15 minutes</strong>.
            Your responses are completely anonymous.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will receive a base payment of <strong>$2.50</strong>. Additional earnings depend on your decisions and those of your partner(s).
        </p>

        <p>The study has three parts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Stage 1 – Trust Game:</strong> You will interact with another participant and make decisions that affect both of your earnings.</li>
            <li><strong>Stage 2 – Reporting Task:</strong> You and your partner will complete a task where matching decisions can lead to a bonus.</li>
            <li><strong>Final – Questionnaire:</strong> You will answer a few short (non-identifying) questions.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your earnings in Stage 1 are determined by the interaction between two roles: Sender and Receiver.</li>
            <li>In Stage 2, the task is repeated for multiple rounds, but <strong>only the result from the final round determines your bonus</strong> for that stage.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you have any questions, you may contact: <strong>Moshe Ram</strong> – <a href="mailto:mosheram@gmail.com">mosheram@gmail.com</a></p>
